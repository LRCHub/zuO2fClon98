Put on your coat, put on your hat
Say goodbye to your welcome mat
Forget your bag, forget yourself
Forget the lines you knew so well

So brace yourself and open up the door
Because it's everybody for themselves

Well, here we go, yeah here we go
You can't say yes you can't say no
You lose your mind you lose your way
You lose your temper every day

And you wonder why you always have to fight
For such an ordinary life

Jane Doe, let it go quiet over there
Jane Doe, puppet show
Wash it from your hair
Don't forget to say a prayer

And as you dive into the street
Your tiny feet don't touch the ground
You got no say, you got no choice
Can't here your voice above the crowd

So here we go, yeah here we go
You can't say yes, you can't say no
You got no time, you got no space
There is no hiding in this place

But don't you let it take your breath away
It's just an ordinary day

Jane Doe, let it go quiet over there
Jane Doe, puppet show
Wash it from your hair
Don't forget to say a prayer
So here we go, yeah here we go
You can't say yes, you can't say no.
