Ayo, Alicia?
What's up, Kandi?
Man, these Jane Does be killing me thinking they slick with it
For real, drop the beat
Alicia Keys
Kandi
Collabo, uh, uh, uh

Let's talk about the situation
'Bout how you came with information
That's negative in every which way
Just dissin' my man and our relations
You say he's cheatin', want me to leave him
I've changed my mind, I think I'll keep him
Listenin' to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm tryin' to be

'Cause I'll be crazy (crazy) to let my man go (man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh, no, oh, no
Just crazy (crazy) to let my man go (man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh, no, oh, no

See I, caught you tryna check my man out
How 'bout you 'xplain what that's all about
Think you slick like I wouldn't know
But I got something for you, Doe
Mess around end up in a chokehold
Girl, I think it's time for you to go
Away from my man and me
That's the way it's gonna be

'Cause I'll be crazy (crazy) to let my man go (man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him, oh, no, oh, no
Just crazy (crazy) to let my man go (my man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh, no, oh, no (no, no)

I love my man
He loves me more
He may not be the perfect man
But I don't plan to let him go for-

Jane Doe
Jane Doe
Jane Doe
Jane Doe
Jane Doe
Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe

'Cause I'll be crazy (crazy, crazy) to let my man go (mm)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him (come tryna steal him, oh no)
Just crazy (I'll be crazy) to let my man go (my man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him, oh, no, oh, no

Crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh, no, oh, no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, (no, no, no, no) oh, no, oh, no
